Aliens with space clubs terrorise the planet, the scientists know this and 
have made contact with them and they say they will eat the humans, thats why 
they don't send people there....

That's what area 51..? is used for - they contact the and try to reason with 
them, but the aliens don't want humans invading their plant with all their
technology and ruining it, like they have done for their own planet, they 
like to live simply.
